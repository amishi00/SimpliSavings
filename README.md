# Simpli Savings
## Problem
Over the past 40 years, the average temperature increase per year is +0.32˚F, making the earth hotter and hotter, leading to floods, droughts, and destruction of habitats. The temperature goes up due to the increasing emissions of greenhouse gases which trap heat on the earth. Electricity production, which requires burning fossil fuels and coal, contributes to 25% of greenhouse gas emissions in the US.

To increase sustainability, we must reduce electricity usage in the near future.

## What it does 
Noticing how many people are inclined to save money more than the environment, Our solution is make a website which incentivizes homeowners if they save electricity. If they use less electricity, then they are given ‘points’ based on how much they saved. $1 saved = 5 points These points can be redeemed in various brands, stores, and objects.

## How we built it
We started by listing out the steps needed to do. Brainstormed the specifics and discussed ideas. We then used replit as a collaboratory coding station where we used our knowledge of html, css, and javascript to create a prototype of the website. 

## Built with
Languages and libraries used include bootstrap, css3, html5, javascript, and jquery.
